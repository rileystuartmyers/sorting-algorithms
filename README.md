# sorting-algorithms
Provides implementation of three sorting algorithms: Selection, Bubble, and Insertion. Double-Linked list functionality is included for bubble sort. 

Input is given as a list of space-separated integers, an endline, and the sorting algorithm to be used for the list of integers. Possible options are 'Selection Sort', 'Bubble Sort', and 'Insertion Sort'. As mentioned above, a linked list with both 'next' and 'prev' links is provided in order for bubble sort to be better represented.

Output is given as a list of comma-separated integers, all enclosed in a set of brackets. Each line printed represents an individual change in the list at each step in the sorting algorithm. This is meant to better visualize the different types of changes being made depending on the algorithm. 

Thank you for reading!
